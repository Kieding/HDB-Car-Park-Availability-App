# Project Description

This is a simple application I wrote in Python to display the availability of HDB Car Parks to users. This was my first final year project I did for my Year 1 Semester 1 in Ngee Ann Poly ICT, enjoy using!

## How to Use (For PC)

Before launching the app, it is important to download the CSV files into your C:\\ main folder in order for the application to function properly. If not, the code will not be able to read the data and the app will not work as intended. 

## Features

Display Total Number of Carparks from a CSV File
Display All Basement Carparks from a CSV File
Read Carpark Availability Data File
Print Total Number of Carparks in the File Read
Display Carparks Without Available Lots
Display Carparks With At Least x% Available Lots
Display Addresses of Carparks With At Least x% Available Lots
